## Project overview:
In this project we are going to work on data from a large social media conglomerate to analyze of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity, give recommendations for a successful IPO and an audit of their big data practice.

We used 3 different data tables which can found in the project data folder for this project.
The data tables were cleaned and analyzed for the following insights:
how many unique categories do we have?
how many reactions are there to the category with the highest post?
which month has the most post?
